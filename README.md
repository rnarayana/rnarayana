### Hi there!

I'm looking to spend more time on open source and learning, and this is the start of that attempt.

- Interests: 
  - Music (Classical, Carnatic, New Age)
  - Reading (Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Historical Fiction,... 
  - Physics, something that started recently.
  - Yoga, again something that started recently.
  
- Guiding principle in life: 'Leave 'em better than you found 'em, whether it be your job or project or people or the world itself'
