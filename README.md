Currently, I'm looking to spend more time on open source and learning, and this is the start of that attempt

- Interests: 
  - Music (Classical, Carnatic, New Age)
  - Reading (Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Historical Fiction, ... Here's me on GoodReads! <https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333436-narayana>
  - Physics, something that started recently.
  - Yoga, again something that started recently.
